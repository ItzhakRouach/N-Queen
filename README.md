# N-Queen
Solving N-Queen problem using Simulate Aneealing
# Introduction
The N-Queen problem its a popular problem where there is a chese board build NxN , with N queen 
to solve the problem you need to find all the loactions of the queens n the board so that eay they dont attack each other
the queens allow to move in straight line up,down,left,right also allow to move in diagonal.
# StepS-to Solution
We solve this by using a popular algorithm called Simulate Aneealing, with Crunchy Formula.
For the implaction we use Python and OOP.
ALSO there is solution only if the numbers of quuens are >= 4.
# Example.py and SimulateAneealing.py
in the file , first we define inital state Randomly (each index location represent the queen column and the number present the row she located in).
args needed to pass:
1. initial state.
2. number of queens.
